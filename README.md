## System Architecture 🏰
<br/>
☝ Client Management system consists of three main components:  <br/>
The front end, the back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.

🎨 Front-end  <br/>
The front end of the platform is built using reactJS which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces also **Loading Skeleton**, which are critical for providing an engaging UI experience to visitors. The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls.Apollo client was used to interacte with the GraphQL query in the backed

⚙️ Back-end  <br/>
The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS and GraphQL, which are popular frameworks for building scalable and robust server-side applications. The back end provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as project update and content patch requests. The back end also handles the logic for processing and storing the images content and user data.

🛢️ Database  <br/>
The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data, images, and PDFs.

### Back-end ⚙️

The back-end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, providing APIs for the front-end to consume. These APIs include functionalities such as user authentication, Project update, and content update. The back-end also handles the logic for processing and storing the images and pdf.

#### Back-end Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization 🔐:** Admin can sign in to the platform using their email addresses and passwords. The platform also supports OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality for added security.
- **Project update 🛠️:** Admin can update project list by adding new project or removing old project from the list.
- **Content edit 💳:** Admin can update any content or phrase on the platform and make all neccessary changes in case or wrong spelling or updated bio.
- **Emails ☁️ :** Admin can access email and review content for dispaly and reply.






### Database 🛢️
The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data. The database stores the course content, user data, and other relevant information related to the platform.
